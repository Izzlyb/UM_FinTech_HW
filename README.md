### the list of tasks that we were suppose to do:

- Navigate to your local git repository folder.
- Modify the README file in the following order:
- Add an H1 header to the README title.
- Add an image. (It doesn't need to be FinTech-related.)
- Add an H2 header for the README description.
- Add an H3 header for the README table of contents.
- Add links to each subfolder within the table of contents.
- Push the changes to the remote git repository.
- Verify the changes by navigating to the GitHub website.

## this is a second header for the README description

### we are going to have 3 subdirectories:
| Name      |       use           |
| ----------| ------------------- |
| code      | program source code |
| data      | Data file           |
